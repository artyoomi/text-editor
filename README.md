Course work on algorithms and data structures in ETU "LETI", 3-rd semester. The program is written in C++, the interface is implemented using ImGui. Because of the burning deadline, everything was written in a hurry, haphazardly and not really tested, so please do not judge strictly, i'm just saving it as a keepsake. :)
